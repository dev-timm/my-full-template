# My very first website

Welcome! [Code institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## html & css

during this project I've created three different html pages plus added a navigation to link between them. The first page contains the logos for html5 as well as ccs3 with links.

Moreover, the first page was styled with a separate style.css file.
